# Here are some advanced features of TypeScript

A summary of classes, interfaces, namespaces, generics and others features in TypeScript:

* __Classes__: In TypeScript, you can create classes that can be used to create objects that have properties and methods.
* __Interfaces__: An interface is a way to define a contract on a function with respect to the arguments and their type.
* __Namespaces__: Namespaces are used to group related code together.
* __Generics__: Generics allow you to write reusable code components that work with different types.
* __Decorators__: A decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter.
* __Mixins__: Mixins are a way to reuse a classâ€™s code in multiple class hierarchies.
* __Contextual typing__: TypeScript can infer types based on context.
